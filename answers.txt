1- How do you think that the provided solution could enhance the sellers’ experience in onboarding new products into our Marketplace?
The provided NER solution automates the extraction of structured product information (e.g. brand, storage size, color, model names) from raw German product descriptions — even if they are messy, unstructured, or contain user-generated content.

Benefits for Seller Onboarding:
I) Faster Listing Creation: Sellers no longer need to manually fill out product attributes — our hybrid NER system automatically identifies key fields. This leads to saving a lot of time for sellers especially when number of products to fill out are huge.

II) Higher Data Consistency: By extracting data using both a trained model and robust rule-based logic, product listings maintain standardized formats (e.g. "512 GB SSD" is consistently recognized).

III) Error Reduction: The fallback rules prevent total failure when the model is uncertain, ensuring entities like brand or storage are still extracted reliably.

IV) Multilingual and Noisy Input Handling: Thanks to hybrid rule-based and machine learning design, the model can handle noicy and messy texts. For example, if the seller does a mistake in typing and grammer (“in silber farbe” instead of “in silberner Farbe”), the model solve it and recognize the wrong format and gives correc entities finally.

V) Improved Search and Filters: Structured product attributes enhance search engine performance and marketplace filtering (e.g., users can search "Red Acer Laptop with 1TB SSD" and get relevant results).

This significantly reduces friction for sellers, improves the data quality in the marketplace, and ultimately leads to better buyer experiences.

4- The shared data was prepared using a naive string matching algorithm for extracting the entities using partially available products' technical attributes. How do you think the data extraction and preparation could be improved?

The initial string-matching approach is limited and can miss variations in spelling, grammar, or phrasing. To improve it:

I) Use pattern-based rules (e.g. with spaCy) instead of simple strings to better catch formats like "512GB SSD" or "superschnelle Festplatte".

II) Build gazetteers for brands, colors, memory sizes, and normalize variants (e.g. "silberne", "silber").

III) Add labeling rules based on context, POS tags, and word shapes to reduce noise.

IV) Include manual review (I mean human check and some tests by which we check the accuracy of our prepration) for a small set of samples to improve quality.

V) Apply data augmentation (synonyms, typos, variations) to make the model more robust.

These steps help generate cleaner, more diverse, and higher-quality training data for better model performance.
